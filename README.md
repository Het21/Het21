## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an experienced senior software developer working on ML & AI projects with the latest CI/CD technologies. My academic background is in Computer Science and Big Data.

You'll either find me working on different projects or researching case studies and research papers to keep myself updated. I am really passionate about the work I do and often tend to take an analytical approach to problem solving.
